Subject: [PATCH] [release-branch.go1.20] net/http: permit requests with
 invalid Host headers

Historically, the Transport has silently truncated invalid
Host headers at the first '/' or ' ' character. CL 506996 changed
this behavior to reject invalid Host headers entirely.
Unfortunately, Docker appears to rely on the previous behavior.

When sending a HTTP/1 request with an invalid Host, send an empty
Host header. This is safer than truncation: If you care about the
Host, then you should get the one you set; if you don't care,
then an empty Host should be fine.

Continue to fully validate Host headers sent to a proxy,
since proxies generally can't productively forward requests
without a Host.

For #60374
Fixes #61431
Fixes #61826
